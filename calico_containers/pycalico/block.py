    A block of IP addresses from which to allocate for IPAM clients.

    Blocks are identified by IP prefix.  Each block is a single, keyed object
    in etcd and the value of the block object in the datastore encodes all the
    allocations for all the IP addresses within that prefix.

    Thus, allocations and releases of IP addresses correspond to changes in the
    block's value.  Compare-and-swap atomicity is used to ensure allocations
    and releases are consistent operations.

    If another process updates the Block in the data store, then we will fail
    to write this one.  The owning code will need to
     - drop the invalid instance,
     - re-read a new instance from the data store,
     - recompute the required modifications, and
     - try the compare-and-swap operation again.
